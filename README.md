# .txt TO .srt - Video Subtitles
A program created with python to fit the txt subtitle into a timeline .srt file for video subtitle purposes. It is just a simple program to help me reduce the time that I should spent on subtitles when I am editing videos. Feel free to adopt the program or contact me for further information about it.

## User Guide
Download this repository as a .zip. Examples of .txt and .srt are included in this repository. Make sure both .txt and .srt files that you wanted to use are in the same folder.
Open and execute the .py file. Only type the name of the file (without .txt or .srt). Then the program will tell are both lines of the files matches.

If not, please go through your files again and check.
If yes, the program will prompt and ask you to enter the name for the new .srt file and the new .srt file will be created with your new subtitles in it.


\*Please be aware that there should be an empty line at the end of the .srt file. As .srt format are as follow:

```text
